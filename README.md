This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard that shows the sales performance of different pizzas from January 2015 to December 2015.
It takes raw sales data and turns it into easy-to-read charts, KPIs, and insights that can help a pizza business understand how it is doing.
With this dashboard, anyone can quickly check:
How much total revenue the business made
How many pizzas were sold and how many orders were placed
Which pizzas are the best sellers and which are the worst sellers
Which categories (Chicken, Veggie, Supreme, Classic) perform the best
Customer ordering patterns, like how many pizzas people usually buy in one order.

🔑 Key Highlights
KPIs at the top → Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Avg Pizzas per Order
Top 5 and Bottom 5 Analysis → by Revenue, by Quantity sold, and by Number of Orders
Interactive Filters → select a time period or pizza category to drill down into the data
Clean Layout → All visuals are centered and styled with consistent colors to make it easy to read.

💡 Why this project is useful
The dashboard makes it easy for business owners and managers to:
Find out which pizzas are bringing in the most money 💰
Spot the pizzas that are not selling well ❌
